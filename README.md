# PizzAPP

You can store you favourite pizzas in this app especially if you order food frequently.
Various parameters such as price, shipping, diameter can be stored for pizzas that can be ordered by e.g. _unit price_. Unit price is a measure of price : area ratio. _Rating_ (i.e. quality) is also a great indicator based on your past experience.
